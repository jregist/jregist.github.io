#Website Analytics

We are in the process of looking at our website through the lens of Google Analytics. The goal is to better understand our site visitors in a way that informs future updates to the site design and content. We have set a goal for 2016 to better understand the goals and behavior of visitors to our site in order to inform decisions about the future development of the site. 

##How does it help us identify the areas most used by visitors so that we prioritize those?

Jobs, People, Firm Profile, Offices, Contact, then we start getting into Work. Almost not even showing up are all the landing pages for services and types. People on the site click on the Dubai office more often that they click on Healthcare.

##How does it clarify the top 10-20 things people do on our site and what we WANT them to be doing?

Obviously there is a disconnect - people do not visit Work as often as we like. They almost never click on News, Publications or Research even though we update those often and they are important internally. 

##What are our current list of priorities with the website and does this data confirm that the usage would warrant those changes?

One thing we don't have clear data about is how often people click on the featured projects in the carousel on the landing page. That is not trackable currently. 

We also need to put into the site some ability to track how often people click on things the VCard and MyBook. These also do track well. We also need to add the ability to track downloads. These we can only track now by the pages where the download link exists. 

##What is the experience of people accessing the site from multiple device types?

TBD
